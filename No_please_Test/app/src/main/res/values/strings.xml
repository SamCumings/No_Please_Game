    <string name="gameRules">Randomly determine which player begins. That player turns over the top card of the deck
    and puts it next to the deck, face-up. Then he has to: \n\n
    <b>•</b> either take the card and put it in front of himself, face-up \n\n
    <b>•</b> or decline it and put one of his chips next to the card. \n\n
    If the player declines the card, play passes to his left-hand neighbor. That player faces the same
    decision: either take the card (and the chip), or decline it and pay one of his chips. In this way,
    the game continues with the turn passing clockwise. Each player in turn decides whether to take
    the card (and all chips next to it), or decline it and add one of his own chips to the pool. \n\n
    <b>❋</b> When finally a player decides to take the card (and all chips next to it), he puts it in front
    of himself face-up and takes the chips up in hand. After that, this player turns over the
    next card of the deck. As described above, he must then decide whether to take the card,
    or decline it and pay a chip. If he declines, the turn to play – and the decision whether
    or not to accept the card – again passes to his left-hand neighbor, and so on. \n\n
    Often, players will decline a card several turns over, so that the number of chips lying next
    to the card becomes quite large. This is absolutely <b>ok</b> – in fact, it’s an interesting aspect
    of the game. \n\n
    <b><u>Example:</u></b> Peter turns over the top card of the deck. It shows the number 11. As this card would get Peter
    11 points, he declines it and puts one of his chips next to it. Sabrina also declines and adds one of her
    chips. Lisa, however, would rather save her chips, so she accepts the card. She puts down the 11 in front
    of herself face-up, and takes the two chips next to it up in hand. Then, Lisa turns over the top card of
    the deck – it’s the 16. Lisa could take the card straight away, but that would get her another 16 points.
    She declines the card, putting one of her chips next to it. Then the game goes on. \n\n
    <b><i>Note:</i></b> To make it easy for all players to see who has how many points, unbroken sequences should
    be placed with the cards overlapping, well separated from single cards. All card values have to be
    clearly visible at all times during the game. \n\n
    The game continues in this manner until all cards of the deck have been used up. As soon
    as the last card of the deck has found a player who accepts it, the game ends and the final
    scores are calculated. \n
